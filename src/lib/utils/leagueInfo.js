  <p>Welcome to our new homepage, everyone. This can be used as a good overview for our league and to check league history a little bit easier, than lets say sleeper right now.</p>
  <p>I'm currently working on the constitution right now. So any suggestions, feel free to place it in chat. Also, we'd like to setup a league meeting somepoint before the season starts. We can discuss rule changes and anything else that comes to mind.</p>
  <p>The draft date is fluid currently. We can all try to find a date to do a draft, or if our schedules are too nuts (some of us had a kid, congrats Carrie and Zach!), we can always opt to do a slow draft. This would involve a 24hr draft allotment for each pick. It could allow some of us with onorthodox schedules to make picks when we have a chance and to allow other users to question why the fuck they'd make that pick after 24hrs of thinking.</p>
  <p>Also, any other suggestions hmu. I'm always around. If I'm not home, I'm driving around Austin, wasting time.</p>
